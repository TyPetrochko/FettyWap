If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
@frenchmontana  big bro  #onehellofanighttour #cokeboys #ZooGang 
Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".
72weeks ago  They see what it is , no need to explain  @nittdagritt remyboymonty1738  #RGF 
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!

Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!

Why is the @GOP being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring #DemDebate?
