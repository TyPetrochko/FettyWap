If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
@frenchmontana … big bro 💯 #onehellofanighttour #cokeboys #ZooGang https://t.co/3xEEa9CJJh
Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".
72weeks ago … They see what it is , no need to explain 💯 @nittdagritt remyboymonty1738 😴🙌🏽 #RGF https://t.co/yvMtB6HxlE
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
